### 👋 About Me

Currently, I am focusing on learning the following programming languages:

1. **R** 📊  
   Learned at university in combination with **ArcGIS** for projects involving **data analysis**, **statistics**, and **geographic information systems (GIS)** 🌍. I enjoy using R for its simplicity and concise syntax, especially in data-heavy contexts.

2. **Python** 🐍  
   I'm using Python to strengthen and apply my **mathematical foundations** ➗ through creative coding — exploring topics such as **number puzzles** 🧩, **geometry** 📐, and **randomness** 🎲 to build a solid understanding of programming logic and structure.

3. **Java** ☕  
   Currently learning the fundamentals of **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, working with **classes**, **methods**, and **GUI applications** using Java Swing. I'm gaining hands-on experience through practical exercises and small interactive projects.

4. **JavaScript** 💻  
   Diving into the world of **web development** with JavaScript, learning how to manipulate the **DOM**, respond to **user interactions**, and build dynamic elements for websites. I'm focused on understanding the language's behavior in the browser environment.

I am passionate about:

- **Mathematics** ➗  
- **Data science** 📊  
- **Geographic information systems (GIS)** 🗺️  
- **Software development** 💻  
- **Web technologies** 🌐  

I'm excited to continue growing my skills in a **creative** 🎨 and **dynamic** ⚡ environment, building projects that blend data, interactivity, and visual design.
