👋 **About Me**  
I'm developing beginner-friendly, practical skills in IT technical support, data analytics, pixel art & game development with Java & creative audio programming with Python.  
I share my projects live on Twitch — not just to share my progress, mistakes, and projects online, but also to connect with others who enjoy building things and exploring creative ideas together.

1. 🔧 **IT Support Fundamentals**  
   Building a foundation in IT support:  
   - Operating systems and basic commands  
   - Hardware setup and troubleshooting  
   - Basic networking and security  
   - User support and issue resolution

2. ☕ **Java for Pixel art & 2D Games**  
   Learning Java by following a project-based book focused on interactive apps and games:  
   - Console games like a Hi-Lo guessing game  
   - GUI development with `JFrame`, `JPanel`, and layout manager  
   - Drawing, animation, and collision detection with timers  
   - Touch-based Android apps with multitouch support  
   - Sharing apps and handling user preferences  
   ...with the goal of using Java to create **Minecraft mods** in the future 🧱🎮

3. 📊 **R + Excel for Data Analytics**  
   Using R and Excel together to explore and analyze structured data.  
   Topics include:  
   - Organizing and cleaning datasets  
   - Statistical testing (e.g. t-tests, correlation, regression)  
   - Data visualization  
   - Reporting results clearly and effectively  
   *(I learned at university R, in combination with ArcGIS for data analysis, and SPSS for statistical analytics)*

5. 🐍 **Python for Music**  
   Exploring music creation and audio programming using Python-based environments like TunePad and EarSketch:  
   - Beat making and rhythm sequencing  
   - Melody generation with lists and loops  
   - Chord progressions and harmonies  
   - Song composition with code  
   - Using Python for creative audio effects and signal processing
