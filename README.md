### 👋 About Me

Currently, I am focusing on learning the programming languages **R**, **Python**, **Java**, and **JavaScript**. 

- I have already learned **R** at university in connection with **ArcGIS**, and I particularly appreciate the language because it is easy to learn and the code tends to be compact. I have worked on several projects using **R** in the fields of **data analysis** 📊, **statistics** 📈, and **geographic information systems (GIS)** 🌍.

At the moment, I am deepening my knowledge of **Python** 🐍 to strengthen and apply my **mathematical foundations** ➗. I am exploring topics such as:

- **Number puzzles** 🧩
- **Geometry** 📐
- **Random numbers** 🎲

These help me build a solid base for mathematical applications in programming.

I have recently started learning **Java** ☕ and **JavaScript** 💻, and I am excited to learn more about **software development** 🖥️ and **web technologies** 🌐.

I am passionate about:

- **Mathematics** ➗
- **Data science** 📊
- **Geographic information systems (GIS)** 🗺️
- **Software development** 💻

And I look forward to expanding my knowledge in a **creative** 🎨 and **dynamic** ⚡ environment.
