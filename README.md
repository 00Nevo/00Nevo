👋 **About Me**  
I'm developing beginner-friendly, practical skills in IT technical support, data analytics with R, pixel art & 2 D game development with Java & creative audio programming with Python.  
I share my projects live on Twitch — not just to share my progress, mistakes, and projects online, but also to connect with others who enjoy building things and exploring creative ideas together.

1. 🔧 **IT Support Fundamentals**  
   Building a foundation in IT support:  
   - Operating systems and basic commands  
   - Hardware setup and troubleshooting  
   - Basic networking and security  
   - User support and issue resolution

2. ☕ **Java**
🎨 **Pixel art & Interactive Art**   
Learning Java through Processing with a visual, art-focused approach:
- Drawing shapes, pixel art, and color composition  
- Building interactive sketches with animation and user input  
- Creating holiday cards, abstract clocks, and generative art  
- Making maze games, paint apps, and photo collages  
- Audio-reactive visuals and custom weather dashboards  
- Connecting Processing to Arduino and sensors

🎮 2D Games & Game Systems** 
Leveling up with structured Java-based game development:
- Programming logic: variables, loops, arrays, functions, OOP  
- Real-time movement, collisions, and frame-based animation  
- Sprite systems, tiling, scrolling, and enemy AI  
- Pixel-perfect collision detection and curve-based motion  
- Sound integration, data handling, and advanced game controls  
- Building reusable systems for game engines in Processing

 ...with the goal of using Java to create **Minecraft mods** in the future 🧱🎮

3. 📊 **R + Excel for Data Analytics**  
   Using R and Excel together to explore and analyze structured data.  
   Topics include:  
   - Organizing and cleaning datasets  
   - Statistical testing (e.g. t-tests, correlation, regression)  
   - Data visualization  
   - Reporting results clearly and effectively  
   *(I learned at university R, in combination with ArcGIS for data analysis, and SPSS for statistical analytics)*

4. 🐍 **Python for Music**  
   Exploring music creation and audio programming using Python-based environments like TunePad and EarSketch:  
   - Beat making and rhythm sequencing  
   - Melody generation with lists and loops  
   - Chord progressions and harmonies  
   - Song composition with code  
   - Using Python for creative audio effects and signal processing
