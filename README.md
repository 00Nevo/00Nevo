👋 About Me
I'm developing beginner-friendly, practical skills in IT technical support, data analytics, creative audio programming with Python, and game development with JavaScript and Java.
I share my projects live on Twitch — not just to share my progress, mistakes, and projects online, but also to connect with others who enjoy building things and exploring creative ideas together.

1. 🔧 **IT Support Fundamentals**   
  Building a foundation in IT support: 
   - Operating systems and basic commands  
   - Hardware setup and troubleshooting  
   - Basic networking and security  
   - User support and issue resolution
     
2. 📊 **R + Excel for Data Analytics**   
   Using R and Excel together to explore and analyze structured data.  
   Topics include:
   - Organizing and cleaning datasets  
   - Statistical testing (e.g. t-tests, correlation, regression)  
   - Data visualization  
   - Reporting results clearly and effectively  
   *(i learned at university R, in combination with ArcGIS for data analysis, and SPSS for statistical analytics)*

3. 🐍 Python for Music 
   Exploring music creation and audio programming using Python-based environments like TunePad and EarSketch:
    - Beat making and rhythm sequencing
    - Melody generation with lists and loops
    - Chord progressions and harmonies
    - Song composition with code
    - Using Python for creative audio effects and signal processing

4. 🟨 JavaScript for Pixel Art for 2D Games
Learning JavaScript by following a hands-on game development book that covers:
    - Game loops, player input, and object management
    - Sprites, collisions, and game state handling
    - Building full games like Jewel Jam and Penguin Pairs
... to prepare for making my own pixel art games using PixiJS, a powerful JavaScript rendering engine for 2D graphics 🎮🧩🎨

5. ☕ Java for Apps & 3D Games (Beginner)
Learning Java by following a project-based book focused on interactive apps and games:
    - Console games like a Hi-Lo guessing game
    - GUI development with JFrame, JPanel, and layout manager
    - Drawing, animation, and collision detection with timers
    - Touch-based Android apps with multitouch support
    - Sharing apps and handling user preferences
... with the goal of using Java to create Minecraft mods in the future 🧱🎮
