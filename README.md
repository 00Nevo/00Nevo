### About Me

Currently, I am focusing on learning the programming languages **R**, **Python**, **Java**, and **JavaScript**. 

- I have already learned **R** at university in connection with **ArcGIS**, and I particularly appreciate the language because it is easy to learn and the code tends to be compact. I have worked on several projects using **R** in the fields of **data analysis**, **statistics**, and **geographic information systems (GIS)**.

At the moment, I am deepening my knowledge of **Python** to strengthen and apply my **mathematical foundations**. I am exploring topics such as:

- **Number puzzles**
- **Geometry**
- **Random numbers**

These help me build a solid base for mathematical applications in programming.

I have recently started learning **Java** and **JavaScript**, and I am excited to learn more about **software development** and **web technologies**.

I am passionate about:

- **Mathematics**
- **Data science**
- **Geographic information systems (GIS)**
- **Software development**

And I look forward to expanding my knowledge in a **creative** and **dynamic environment**.
